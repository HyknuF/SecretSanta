# Wichtelgenerator / Secret Santa Generator

Free (as in Speech) and Open Source Secret Santa generator!

The Script itself is in german at the moment, but should easily to use for everyone.

I will provide a english version as soon as possible.

## Background / Info

Last year, I couldn't find a tool with this feature set, so i wrote my own :)

It randomly triggers Secret Santa groups based on their names and sends an email to all participants.
- The number of participants is dynamic and arbitrary.
- **Communication with the mail server is SSL encrypted.**
- It's a commandline tool, no fancy GUI and such. Only you and the text.

## Advantages?

- Even the planner does not know the Secret Santa groups. 
- E-mails are automatically generated with all key data and sent to all participants.
- No hassle for the planner
